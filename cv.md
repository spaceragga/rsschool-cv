## Summary

I’m going to start working as a Web Developer in IT. I came to this for a long time, first of all in my head, and now the time has come.

I spent most of my life in front of a computer and I think that in striving to learn it, nothing is impossible and there is no limit.

I believe that a person can do everything that another can and even more.
